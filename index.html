                      <p> I started out as a freelance writer nearly 8 years ago but have since morphed into a front-end web developer. <br>
                      I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital 
                      products for both business and consumer use. <br>
                      I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chops.</p>
