      <h2> Hi, I'm Emmanuel. Nice to meet you </h2>
      <p> I started out as a freelance writer nearly 8 years ago but have since morphed into a front-end web developer. <p><br>
      <p>I've done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital 
        products for both business and consumer use. </p><br>
      <p>I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually improving my chops.</p>
